 		- more transaction sorting options including javascript filter functions
 		- daily/monthly etc. expense graphs
 		- category autocomplete and autocomplete in general
 		- implement edit transaction 	
 	- Mid Term:
 		- screen size based layout
 		- fetching tcf balance and transactions and doing amount based compare
 		- auto send email to dad for any transaction above $20
